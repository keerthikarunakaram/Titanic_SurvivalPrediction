# Titanic_SurvivalPrediction

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

We need to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Machine Learning Models Used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K fold Method cross validation
2. Gini Decision Tree
3. Entropy Decistion Tree

Using K-fold approach test accuracy of 100% is achieved.
